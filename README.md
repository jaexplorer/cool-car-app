# Cool Car App

## Improvements to be made

Due to limited time there are a few improvement I would make if I had more time

- Mobile Responsiveness
- Proper State handling using either the Context API or Redux
- Input Validation on the when adding a new cool car + error handling
- Authentication
- More extensive tests
